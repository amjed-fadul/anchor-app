## Form Validation

### Client-Side Validation (JavaScript)

// Real-time validation on blur
document.querySelectorAll('.form-input').forEach(input => {
  input.addEventListener('blur', validateField);
});

// Enable submit button when form is valid
function checkFormValidity() {
  const form = document.getElementById('beta-signup-form');
  const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submit-btn');
  submitBtn.disabled = !form.checkValidity();
}

// Validate individual field
function validateField(event) {
  const field = event.target;
  const errorSpan = document.getElementById(`${field.id}-error`);

  if (!field.validity.valid) {
    errorSpan.textContent = field.validationMessage;
    field.classList.add('error');
  } else {
    errorSpan.textContent = '';
    field.classList.remove('error');
  }

  checkFormValidity();
}
```

### Server-Side Validation

**Required Validations:**
1. Email format validation
2. Email uniqueness check (no duplicate signups)
3. Sanitize all inputs (prevent XSS)
4. Rate limiting (max 5 submissions per IP per hour)
5. CAPTCHA verification (optional, for spam prevention)

# FAQ Content

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When does the beta start?
Beta invites will be sent in waves starting **December 2025**. Early signups receive priority access. Expect your invite within 1-2 weeks of the first wave.

### What platforms are supported?
Anchor beta is available on:
- **iOS:** iPhone and iPad (iOS 15+) via TestFlight
- **Android:** Phones and tablets (Android 12+) via APK download
- **Web:** Desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

### Is my data safe during beta?
Yes! We use industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest) and store data on Supabase's secure infrastructure. However, since this is beta software, we **strongly recommend backing up important links** elsewhere. You can export your data anytime from app settings.

### Will I lose my data after beta ends?
No! Your beta account will automatically transition to a production account when we launch. All your saved links, tags, and spaces will be preserved. You'll also get grandfathered pricing (50% off first year) as a thank you for testing.

### How long is the beta period?
The beta will run for **3-4 months** (December 2025 - Q1 2026). We'll notify you at least 2 weeks before beta ends and the public launch happens.

### Will Anchor be free?
Anchor will have a **free tier** with core features (unlimited links, 3 spaces, basic search). Premium features (unlimited spaces, advanced search, team sharing) will be available via subscription ($5/month or $50/year). Beta testers get premium free during beta + 50% off first year.

### Can I share my beta access with friends?
Beta accounts are **non-transferable** and tied to your email address. However, you can refer friends to join the waitlist! For every 3 referrals who sign up, you move up 10 spots in the queue (and they do too!).

### What should I do if I find a bug?
We **love** bug reports! You can report bugs in three ways:
1. **In-App:** Settings → Report a Bug (fastest!)
2. **Email:** bugs@anchor.app
3. **GitHub Issues:** (link provided in beta invite)

Please include: device type, OS version, steps to reproduce, and screenshots if possible.

### How do I provide feedback?
We want to hear from you! Send feedback via:
1. **In-App:** Settings → Send Feedback
2. **Email:** feedback@anchor.app
3. **Weekly Surveys:** We'll send short surveys every Friday

Your input directly influences our product roadmap!

### Can I use Anchor for work/commercial purposes during beta?
Yes, but with caution. Beta software may have bugs or data loss risks, so we recommend using it for **non-critical work** only. For mission-critical links, please maintain backups in another tool until public launch.

### What happens if I want to leave the beta?
You can leave anytime by:
1. Deleting your account in Settings → Account → Delete Account
2. Emailing beta@anchor.app

Before deleting, **export your data** (Settings → Export Data) so you don't lose your links!

### How do I install the beta on iOS?
1. Download **TestFlight** from the App Store (if you don't have it)
2. Click the invite link in your beta access email
3. TestFlight will open and show Anchor
4. Tap "Install" and you're good to go!

### How do I install the beta on Android?
1. Enable **"Install from Unknown Sources"** in Settings → Security
2. Download the Anchor APK from the link in your email
3. Open the downloaded APK file and tap "Install"
4. Launch Anchor and sign up!

*(Note: We're working on getting Anchor into Google Play Beta program — stay tuned!)*

### Is there a limit to how many links I can save?
During beta, there's a **soft limit of 500 links per account** to ensure performance. This limit will be removed (or significantly increased) at public launch. Free tier will have unlimited links!

### Can I import my existing bookmarks?
Not yet! Import functionality (from Chrome, Safari, Pocket, Raindrop, etc.) is planned for **January 2026**. For now, you'll need to save links manually. We'll notify beta testers when import is ready!

### Do you have a mobile app?
Yes! Anchor has native apps for **iOS and Android**, plus a web app for desktop. The mobile apps include share extensions so you can save links from any app in under 1 second.

### How do I delete my account?
Go to Settings → Account → Delete Account. This will **permanently delete** all your data (links, tags, spaces). Make sure to export your data first!

### Can I change my email address?
Yes! Go to Settings → Account → Change Email. You'll need to verify the new email address. Note: Your beta access is tied to your original email, so contact us at beta@anchor.app if you have issues.

### What browsers are supported for the web app?
Anchor Web works best on:
- Chrome/Chromium (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

We recommend using Chrome for the best experience during beta.
